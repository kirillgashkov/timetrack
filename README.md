# TimeTrack

TimeTrack is a simple time tracking tool that allows you to track your time spent on different tasks.

It is a multi-user server application that stores the time tracking data in a PostgreSQL database and communicates with
(pseudo-) external services to provide additional information about the users.

It was created as a test assignment for a job application in July 2024.
